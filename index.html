                <h3>What can Peter Obi do to win the upcoming election?</h3>
                The 2023 presidential election is less than 177 days away and the momentum is growing for the candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi. Will it be enough to pull a surprise victory in the 2023 presidential election? It becomes imperative to examine what else Obi can do to make such a victory happen. As a matter of fact, Obi needs to win to prove that his millions of online-savvy supporters are real and up to the task. The criteria for winning the political contest are always in place, but the challenge is how to seize the opportunity to take power at the centre. As the September 28 flag-off date for presidential campaign approaches, the Obi-dients need to sustain the existing tempo perfectly till February 2023 to be able to spring surprises at the poll. Until recently, many underestimated Obi's dexterity in comparative socio-economics; his will to bring a change in governance; and the support he enjoys from young Nigerians. Many leaders have claimed to have achieved a lot while trying to fix the problems of Nigeria, but obvious metrics suggested they have sorely failed. The Labour Party candidate already stands a chance of winning the 2023 presidential election, but here are some few other things that he still needs to put into consideration; <br> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Harnessing the Diaspora support base</li>
                    <li>Raising momentum for fund raising</li>
                    <li>Promoting Labour governorship candidates</li>
                    <li>Intensifying voter registration.</li>
                    <li>Revisiting alliance and merger.</li>
                    <li>Reaching out to core Arewa leadership.</li>

                <h3>Can Arsenal go all the way to clinch Title glory?</h3>
                The Premier League title race is about to get real for Arsenal. For the first time since Arsene Wenger's "Invincibles" won the club's last title in 2003-04, Arsenal feel like a team that can go all the way and take the trophy to the Emirates. But manager Mikel Arteta's side have only done the easy part so far. Make no mistake: to be five points clear at the top of table, having suffered just one defeat in 14 games, is a genuine achievement for Arteta and his young team. Arsenal deserve to be leading the race as the Premier League resumes after six-week pause for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, but their impressive start to the season is now just money in the bank. We are about to see how far it will take them. Since the Premier League began in 1992-93, there have been 30 completed seasons and the team that sits top on Christmas Day just has the edge. Sixteen teams have been top at Christmas and ended up as champions, with 14 clubs failing to go the distance. Arsenal were second to Manchester United on Christmas Day 2003 and went on to be champions. It is a slightly skewed historically statistic this time around, with Arsenal only having played 14 games due to the World Cup shutdown. By now, teams have usually played 17 games, so it is perhaps unfair to burden Arteta's team with the pressure of having to live up to the "Christmas leaders" tag. But by starting so well and maintaining their form, Arsenal are unquestionably in the title race. Reigning champions Manchester City are still the favourites with every bookmaker, despite being five points adrift of the leaders, yet Pep Guardiola's team will have little margin for error if Arsenal continue as they left off. This is the challenge for Arsenal, however, and the picture is no longer quite as clear as it was when they wrapped up for the World Cup with a 2-0 win at Wolves in mid-November. The biggest concern for Arteta will be the loss of striker Gabriel Jesus, who could be sidelined for up to four months with a medial ligament injury he suffered with Brazil at the World Cup. The 25-year-old has scored five goals for the Gunners since his £45 million transfer from Man City in the summer and while his strike rate may not be hugely impressive, it is his contribution as a team player and the winning mentality he has brought from his time at the Etihad that make him so important to Arteta's team. Without Jesus, Arsenal have to find a way to make their forward line function just as well -- and that won't be easy. On the flipside, winger Bukayo Saka had an outstanding World Cup with England, and fellow wide attacker Gabriel Martinelli is reportedly close to signing a contract extension at the Emirates after returning from the World Cup with Brazil. So amid the concerns, there have been positives for Arteta to build on. So we will all watch and see if the 'elephant' can stay on top of the table to the very end.

                <h3>Chelsea's spending spree</h3>
                Chelsea have made history after becoming the Premier League's biggest ever spenders in a single transfer window, splashing out an eye-watering £271.1million over the summer. Led by new co-owner Todd Boehly, Thomas Tuchel's side signed 11 players before the window slammed shut at 11pm on Thursday night, with their most expensive recruit - £69.5m Wesley Fofana - joining from Leicester on the penultimate day. Fofana joins the likes of Denis Zakaria (loan) , Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (£10m), Marc Cucurella (£62m), Raheem Sterling (£50m), Kalidou Koulibaly (£34m) and a host of young talent in joining the Premier League giants this summer. Boehly's summer of lavish spending ensured Chelsea broke Manchester City's record for most money invested in a single window, which they set at £223.65m in 2017. Sterling kicked things off by completing a sensational move from City to their Premier League rivals, penning a five-year deal worth more than £300,000-a-week with the London club. Chelsea forked out £50m for Sterling, who left City as their second top scorer in European football, only behind Sergio Aguero, in search of more regular playing time ahead of this winter's World Cup in Qatar. The Blues also confirmed the surprise signing of Koulibaly from Napoli in a deal worth £34m. The defender was their second summer arrival, signing a four-year contract to help strengthen Tuchel's defence after the departures of Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen. As well as beating Manchester City's Premier League spending record from 2017, Chelsea also trumped their own record from 2020 when they spent a total of £222.48m. After parting ways with Thomas Tuchel, The Blues have endured a torrid time under Graham Potter, slipping down to 10th in the Premier League table and almost out of contention for a top four spot. Chelsea spent an amazing £286 million in the January transfer window, bringing their total cost for the 2022/23 season to £539 million. In fact, if we include transfer add-ons and the £10 million loan fee to secure Joao Felix's services for six months, the outlay in January was £327 million, with the total expenditure for the season being £603 million. Adding the £63 million pledged to buy Christopher Nkunku from RB Leipzig in the summer brings the total to a frightening £666 million. Chelsea spent another quarter of a billion pounds this summer, including big-money purchases of Wesley Fofana, Marc Cucurella, Raheem Sterling, and Kalidou Koulibaly, several of whom are presently on the bench. To put Chelsea's spending in context, it was £180 million more than the rest of the Big Six combined. Chelsea spent significantly more than La Liga, the Bundesliga, Serie A, and Ligue 1 combined. Chelsea's economic strategy has relied heavily on the accounting treatment of player trading in recent years, since it has essentially been to offset substantial operating deficits with gains from player sales.

                <h3>LeBron James breaks NBA all-time scoring record</h3>
                LeBron James has become the NBA's all-time leading scorer, passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 39-year-old record. Los Angeles Lakers star James, 38, hit 38 points in a 133-130 defeat by the Oklahoma City Thunder to surpass Abdul-Jabbar's mark of 38,387. Abdul-Jabbar initially broke the scoring record in April 1984, eight months before James was born. "To be able to be in the presence of a legend and great as Kareem, it means so much to me," said James. James, who needed 36 points to break the record, did so with a fadeaway jumper at the end of the third quarter and he finished the match with a career total of 38,390. An emotional James rose both arms in celebration while 75-year-old Abdul-Jabbar, who was at the match at the Lakers home court, stood and applauded. There was a brief break in play for a ceremony to mark the achievement, with James taking a microphone to make a speech on court. "Everybody that has ever been a part of this run with me the last 20-plus years, I want to say thank you so much because I wouldn't be me without all you. You all helped. Your passion and sacrifices helped me to get to this point," he said. "And to the NBA to Adam Silver, to the late great David Stern, thank you very much for allowing me to be a part of something I always dreamed about. I would never in a million years dreamt this to be even better than what it is tonight." Abdul-Jabbar ceremoniously handed over the ball to James to recognise his new record in front of a cheering crowd that included tennis legend John McEnroe, music stars Jay-Z, LL Cool J and Bad Bunny, boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr and actor Denzel Washington. "I thought it had every chance of being broken. It just had to have someone that the offense focused on continually," said Abdul-Jabbar, who retired in 1989. "LeBron's career is one of someone who planned to dominate this game. You have to give him credit for just the way he played and for the way he's lasted and dominated." Four-time NBA champion James is in his 20th season in the NBA, having been drafted first overall by hometown team the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003. The forward joined the Miami Heat in 2010, winning two titles, before returning to lead Cleveland to the only NBA title in their history in 2016. He has been with the Lakers since 2018 and helped them win the 2020 title, which was also the fourth time he has been named NBA finals MVP. Two-time Olympic champion James has won four regular season MVP titles and appeared in the NBA Finals 10 times. Abdul-Jabbar played in the NBA for 20 seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks and Lakers, during which he won six titles, six regular season MVP crowns and was named finals MVP twice. Asked after the game whether he is the best NBA player of all time, James said: "I'll let everybody else decide who that is or just talk about it, but it's great barbershop talk. "Me personally, I'm going to take myself against anybody who's ever played this game. But everyone's going to decide who their favourite is." James holds the records as the youngest player to reach every significant points tally from 5,000 to 35,000. He passed six-time NBA champion Michael Jordan into fourth overall in March 2019 and late Lakers great Kobe Bryant to move into third all-time in January 2020. James then surpassed Karl Malone into second overall in March last year, a month after he beat Abdul-Jabbar's record for the most combined regular season and play-off points. The NBA's official all-time scoring list only takes into account regular season points. James, a 19-time All-Star, scored 23,119 points in 849 games for the Cavaliers during 11 seasons across two spells. He scored 7,919 points for the Heat in 294 games over four seasons and now has 7,314 points in 266 games over five seasons for the Lakers. James is also in the top-10 all-time lists for assists, steals, defensive rebounds, field goals made and three-pointers made.

                <h3>Trump's Instagram, Facebook accounts reinstated ahead of 2024 election</h3>
                Meta has announced it is reinstating former president Donald Trump's accounts on Facebook and Instagram after a two-year suspension over his alleged role in praising the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Nick Clegg, the company's president of global affairs, wrote in a blog post that Trump's accounts would be reinstated in the coming weeks but that the former president will face “heightened penalties” if he breaks the social media giant's content rules. “The public should be able to hear what their politicians are saying - the good, the bad and the ugly - so that they can make informed choices at the ballot box,” Clegg wrote. “But that does not mean there are no limits to what people can say on our platform.” According to The Washington Post, The announcement follows a formal request from a lawyer for Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign to allow him to return to the platform, arguing that a two-year ban in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 attack has “dramatically distorted and inhibited the public discourse." Meta's reinstatement — along with Twitter's decision in November to lift a permanent ban against Trump — means the former president once again has the ability to reclaim the spotlight using two of the most pivotal social media platforms in the world ahead of a presidential election in which he is a declared candidate. Being reinstated to Facebook means Trump will be able to resume fundraising for his presidential campaign. While Trump's primary political action committee, Save America, has been spending money on Facebook ads, his own page has been frozen. Meta suspended Trump's accounts on Jan. 7, 2021, following his praise and encouragement of rioters who stormed the Capitol in an attack that left several dead and many more injured. The company then shortened the suspension to two years and said it would reassess whether it was safe enough to restore his account when that period was over. Clegg said Wednesday that Meta had to evaluate whether there were still “extraordinary circumstances” that justified the company extending his suspension. After evaluating the “current environment” including risks surrounding the 2022 midterm elections, the company determined expanding the suspension was no longer necessary, Clegg said. “Our determination is that the risk has sufficiently receded and that we should therefore adhere to the two-year timeline we set out,” Clegg wrote. “As such, we will be reinstating Mr. Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts in the coming weeks.”

                <h3>Chinese spy balloon shot down</h3>
                The Pentagon did not shoot down the Chinese balloon as it approached Alaska in late January because it did not pose a military threat to the United States or Canada, the top commander for defending the United States said Monday. The balloon, which Pentagon officials said was built to spy on sensitive military sites, was shot down Saturday off the coast of South Carolina after entering the country in Alaska. Air Force Gen. Glen VanHerck, commander of U.S. Northern Command and the North American Aerospace Defense Command, briefed reporters on the decision to allow the balloon to track across the United States, recovery efforts and previous balloon incursions. The balloon captivated Americans' attention, fueled rage on Capitol Hill and created a diplomatic rupture with China. Secretary of State Antony Blinken canceled a planned trip to China as the balloon floated over the United States. The balloon measured 200 feet, and the intelligence payload was about the size of a regional jetliner and weighed thousands of pounds, VanHerck said. Debris from shooting it down earlier could have killed civilians on the ground, Pentagon officials have said. The debris field in the ocean off the coast of South Carolina stretches 15 football fields by 15 football fields, VanHerck said. It is being treated as potential hazardous waste because explosives might have been aboard to destroy sensitive equipment. However, there has been no indication that the balloon carried explosives, he said. By the time it crossed into the United States at the Aleutian Islands Jan. 28, the balloon had been assessed as a surveillance device. It did not pose a military threat, VanHerck said, so it could not be shot down. “I could not take immediate action because it was not demonstrating hostile act or hostile intent,” VanHerck said. Military officials took action to shield sensitive sites along the balloon's path to limit its effectiveness, VanHerck said. Intelligence was also gained by studying its capabilities. He refused to say if electronic jamming devices were used to prevent it from transmitting information to China. On Saturday, Pentagon officials revealed that suspected Chinese spy balloons had entered U.S. airspace three times during the Trump administration and once earlier in the Biden administration. Those incursions were not known at the time they occurred, VanHerck said. The U.S. intelligence community determined they occurred after the fact, he said. NASA provided models that showed the debris from shooting it down could stretch over six miles, VanHerck said. That is why commanders waited until it was six miles offshore before an F-22 fired an AIM-9 sidewinder missile with an explosive warhead into the balloon at 2:39 p.m. ET on Saturday, he said. Navy and Coast Guard ships are patrolling the area where it splashed down, VanHerck said. Strong currents prevented recovery efforts on Sunday, he said. Navy explosive ordnance disposal teams were on the site Monday assessing the debris, which is in about 50 feet of water. They will look for explosives that may have been aboard the balloon to destroy it, although there are no initial signs of such devices, he said. They will also look for potentially hazardous waste such as batteries and broken glass from solar panels. FBI counterintelligence officials are embedded with the Navy to examine and exploit potential sensitive material that is recovered, VanHerck said.
