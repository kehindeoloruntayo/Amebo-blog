                <h3>What can Peter Obi do to win the upcoming election?</h3>
                The 2023 presidential election is less than 177 days away and the momentum is growing for the candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi. Will it be enough to pull a surprise victory in the 2023 presidential election? It becomes imperative to examine what else Obi can do to make such a victory happen. As a matter of fact, Obi needs to win to prove that his millions of online-savvy supporters are real and up to the task. The criteria for winning the political contest are always in place, but the challenge is how to seize the opportunity to take power at the centre. As the September 28 flag-off date for presidential campaign approaches, the Obi-dients need to sustain the existing tempo perfectly till February 2023 to be able to spring surprises at the poll. Until recently, many underestimated Obi's dexterity in comparative socio-economics; his will to bring a change in governance; and the support he enjoys from young Nigerians. Many leaders have claimed to have achieved a lot while trying to fix the problems of Nigeria, but obvious metrics suggested they have sorely failed. The Labour Party candidate already stands a chance of winning the 2023 presidential election, but here are some few other things that he still needs to put into consideration; <br> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Harnessing the Diaspora support base</li>
                    <li>Raising momentum for fund raising</li>
                    <li>Promoting Labour governorship candidates</li>
                    <li>Intensifying voter registration.</li>
                    <li>Revisiting alliance and merger.</li>
                    <li>Reaching out to core Arewa leadership.</li>

                <h3>Can Arsenal go all the way to clinch Title glory?</h3>
                The Premier League title race is about to get real for Arsenal. For the first time since Arsene Wenger's "Invincibles" won the club's last title in 2003-04, Arsenal feel like a team that can go all the way and take the trophy to the Emirates. But manager Mikel Arteta's side have only done the easy part so far. Make no mistake: to be five points clear at the top of table, having suffered just one defeat in 14 games, is a genuine achievement for Arteta and his young team. Arsenal deserve to be leading the race as the Premier League resumes after six-week pause for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, but their impressive start to the season is now just money in the bank. We are about to see how far it will take them. Since the Premier League began in 1992-93, there have been 30 completed seasons and the team that sits top on Christmas Day just has the edge. Sixteen teams have been top at Christmas and ended up as champions, with 14 clubs failing to go the distance. Arsenal were second to Manchester United on Christmas Day 2003 and went on to be champions. It is a slightly skewed historically statistic this time around, with Arsenal only having played 14 games due to the World Cup shutdown. By now, teams have usually played 17 games, so it is perhaps unfair to burden Arteta's team with the pressure of having to live up to the "Christmas leaders" tag. But by starting so well and maintaining their form, Arsenal are unquestionably in the title race. Reigning champions Manchester City are still the favourites with every bookmaker, despite being five points adrift of the leaders, yet Pep Guardiola's team will have little margin for error if Arsenal continue as they left off. This is the challenge for Arsenal, however, and the picture is no longer quite as clear as it was when they wrapped up for the World Cup with a 2-0 win at Wolves in mid-November. The biggest concern for Arteta will be the loss of striker Gabriel Jesus, who could be sidelined for up to four months with a medial ligament injury he suffered with Brazil at the World Cup. The 25-year-old has scored five goals for the Gunners since his £45 million transfer from Man City in the summer and while his strike rate may not be hugely impressive, it is his contribution as a team player and the winning mentality he has brought from his time at the Etihad that make him so important to Arteta's team. Without Jesus, Arsenal have to find a way to make their forward line function just as well -- and that won't be easy. On the flipside, winger Bukayo Saka had an outstanding World Cup with England, and fellow wide attacker Gabriel Martinelli is reportedly close to signing a contract extension at the Emirates after returning from the World Cup with Brazil. So amid the concerns, there have been positives for Arteta to build on. So we will all watch and see if the 'elephant' can stay on top of the table to the very end.

                <h3>Trump's Instagram, Facebook accounts reinstated ahead of 2024 election</h3>
                Meta has announced it is reinstating former president Donald Trump's accounts on Facebook and Instagram after a two-year suspension over his alleged role in praising the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Nick Clegg, the company's president of global affairs, wrote in a blog post that Trump's accounts would be reinstated in the coming weeks but that the former president will face “heightened penalties” if he breaks the social media giant's content rules. “The public should be able to hear what their politicians are saying - the good, the bad and the ugly - so that they can make informed choices at the ballot box,” Clegg wrote. “But that does not mean there are no limits to what people can say on our platform.” According to The Washington Post, The announcement follows a formal request from a lawyer for Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign to allow him to return to the platform, arguing that a two-year ban in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 attack has “dramatically distorted and inhibited the public discourse." Meta's reinstatement — along with Twitter's decision in November to lift a permanent ban against Trump — means the former president once again has the ability to reclaim the spotlight using two of the most pivotal social media platforms in the world ahead of a presidential election in which he is a declared candidate. Being reinstated to Facebook means Trump will be able to resume fundraising for his presidential campaign. While Trump's primary political action committee, Save America, has been spending money on Facebook ads, his own page has been frozen. Meta suspended Trump's accounts on Jan. 7, 2021, following his praise and encouragement of rioters who stormed the Capitol in an attack that left several dead and many more injured. The company then shortened the suspension to two years and said it would reassess whether it was safe enough to restore his account when that period was over. Clegg said Wednesday that Meta had to evaluate whether there were still “extraordinary circumstances” that justified the company extending his suspension. After evaluating the “current environment” including risks surrounding the 2022 midterm elections, the company determined expanding the suspension was no longer necessary, Clegg said. “Our determination is that the risk has sufficiently receded and that we should therefore adhere to the two-year timeline we set out,” Clegg wrote. “As such, we will be reinstating Mr. Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts in the coming weeks.”
